# K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm from Scratch

## Algorithm
1. Calculate Euclidean distance between the test samples and each row of the train set
2. Sort the distances by distance value, from lowest to highest
3. Take the distance of the k smallest ones
4. Take the value of target variable for these k train set rows
5. Highest Count target variable is chosen

* Implementation of scikit-learn is highly optimized for performance
